/* maybe we will want to make the game tick less often on the server
 * to save CPU cycles, or maybe we need to tick the game faster
 * to resolve a timing bug.
 *
 * by configuring times like 2*SECOND_IN_TICKS, not only does the
 * developer get to think in terms of a unit they're already
 * familiar with -- seconds -- they also get the ability to
 * change how many times per second their game logic runs,
 * simply by changing this variable. */

/* we've all been there.
 *
 * you're trying to get the speed of the boss's attack
 * juuust right, but it takes you 10 minutes of minion smashing
 * to get to the boss chamber.
 *
 * you're going to need to tweak the parameters a hundred
 * times, at least, and that means that your'e going to have to
 * spend 1,000 minutes -- 16 hours -- just grinding minions.
 *
 * And that's just for this single boss?
 *
 * Fuck that.
 *
 * Wouldn't it be incredible if you could hide behind a pillar
 * as the boss prepares for its next onslaught, change some code,
 * and see it immediately take effect?
 *
 * With this "state hack" I'll show you in the following lines,
 * you can do just that.
 *
 * The way it works is by taking all of the information the game
 * needs -- all of its "state" and storing it in a single object.
 * This single object is then cached in localStorage, which persists
 * across reloads. If your code changes, it's still the same.
 *
 * Every frame, the game takes this information out of local storage,
 * updates it accordingly, and then puts it back.
 * If you change the code that's being run in your web browser,
 * the state is still there waiting for you from last frame.
 *
 * If you tweak that value and reload just as the boss is taking
 * a swing at you, suddenly his hammer slows down to just the right
 * amount and you're able to dodge around it and deliver the killing
 * blow. */
